## 🚀 How It Works

This repository uses GitHub Pages to host a static website that provides access to MP3 files stored in the `source/` directory. The main page (`index.html`) creates an interactive music player interface that allows you to browse and play all available tracks.

## 🔧 Adding New Music

To add new music files:
1. Upload your MP3 files to the `source/` directory
2. Update the `musicFiles` array in `index.html` with the new filename
3. Commit and push your changes
4. GitHub Pages will automatically update the site

## 📱 Compatibility

The music player works with any modern web browser that supports HTML5 audio, including:
- Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Mobile browsers on iOS and Android

Enjoy your music! 🎧
